## future todo

- [x] make new block styling nodes go inside (this can be done during the fixDisallowedChildrenOfNode process, by entering block nodes (this could break joining, however))
- [x] bug: when list styling `<p><p>abc</p></p><p><p>abc</p></p><p><p>abc</p></p>`, where all Ps have margin, uneven list ordering
- [x] possibly join adjacent lists during indent
- [ ] join adjacent lists during outdent
- [ ] consider joining adjacent list nodes during indent, event at different levels. see `<ol><li><ol><li><ol><li>abc</li></ol></li></ol></li><li><ol><li>abc</li></ol></li></ol>`
- [ ] detectStyling for font sizes (em, etc.), superscript/subscript in css
- [ ] remove extraneous style nodes
- [ ] bugs (fix empty styling elements, may be a possibility of text in empty text thing)
- [ ] bugs (when adjusting start container to be relative to inline nodes in getNextTextNodeInRange and applyStyleToBlockNode, it is not considering empty nodes);
- [ ] maybe think about fixing nested divs when pasting (not joining sufficiently)
- [ ] when adjusting range to be relative to inline nodes, it should properly handle empty nodes and properly traverse
  - it should always move in the direction of the endpoint (left for startContainer, right for endContainer)
  - if it hits the end of the editor:
    - if we are trying to adjust ranges for block styling, it should just use the editor as an endpoint
    - otherwise for getTextNodesInRange it should make a new text node
- [ ] issue with getBlockNodesInRange: if the whole last node is included, include it as a whole (possibilities of fixing this: have tne end node always escape?)
- [ ] perhaps remove extraneous divs during paste
- [ ] make single backspace/delete cursor feature work with images (or not)
- [ ] figure out issue with whitespace trimming
- [ ] paste plaintext (add cursor support)
- [ ] make removeExtraneousParents work recursively (handle `<div><div>abc<div>abc</div>abc</div></div>abc`)
- [ ] handle empty nodes when joining lists in applyBlockStyle
